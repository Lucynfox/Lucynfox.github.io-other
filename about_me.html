			<p class="about_me_paragraph">  I started out my career with an Apprenticeship in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering working for the Ministry of Defence and then continued on to work in Areospace engineering teams within the MoD.  I then moved on to National Grid where I worked as a Project Supervisor on the Hinkley Point C Connection Project.  The project involved a huge amount of construction work such as new Substations and Underground & Overhead Line builds in order to connect the energy output from the new Nuclear Power Station to the National Grid Infrastructure. </p><br>
			<p>In my spare time I started to become interested in programming and worked my way through various online courses which resulted in me eventually joining iO Academy, a 16 week full-time intensive course, to study programming and learn all the skills required of a Software Developer. </p><br>
			<p class="about_me_paragraph">  
				I really love to travel, in total I have spent around 12 months backpacking and have visited over 30 countries.  I have had the most amazing experiences from Bungee Jumping in South Africa, to climbing a Volcano in Guatemala and Scuba Diving in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.  My other hobbies include indoor rock climbing, bouldering and studying Spanish. </p>
